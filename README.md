# RedditDailyAffirmationBot
A bot that delivers daily affirmations from the SNL character Stuart Smalley on demand.

Uses mattbdean's JRAW 1.1.0 to interface with the Reddit API and internal logic to randomize affirmations.

Affirmation content credit to Al Franken with adaptations from Ron Fleming.

Thanks to Dave Hoy for Github-specific recommendations.

Upcoming changes include:

1) More content
2) Possible new logical layers to affirmation generation
3) Looping and time tracking to post on a schedule
4) Interactive component to get affirmations on demand within Reddit
