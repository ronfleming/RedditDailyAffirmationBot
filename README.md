# RedditDailyAffirmationBot
A bot that delivers daily affirmations from the SNL character Stuart Smalley when run.

Uses mattbdean's JRAW 1.1.0 to consume the Reddit API and internal logic to randomize affirmations.

Affirmation content credit to Al Franken with adaptations from Ron Fleming.

Thanks to Dave Hoy for Github-specific recommendations, and to Margaret Green for reminding me how parentheses work.

Upcoming changes include:

1) More content
2) Possible new logical layers for generating affirmations
3) Looping and time tracking to post on a schedule
4) Interactive component to get affirmations on demand within Reddit
